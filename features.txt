Next logical step: individual slice selection before exporting. You’d be able to click (or toggle) tiles on the grid to mark which ones to include in the export. Here’s what it includes:
✅ Features to implement:
Click on a tile to toggle its selected/unselected state.
Only selected tiles get exported (or all if none are selected).
Visual indicator for selected tiles (e.g. blue overlay with tooltip).
Clear selection/reset selection option.




Next up: implement slice preview thumbnails before download.
Plan:
After slicing is complete, display thumbnails of non-empty tiles before downloading.
Add a “Download ZIP” button to trigger export.
Optionally allow deselecting specific thumbnails.
Implementation outline:
Store preview blobs in a slices ref after slicing.
Render them in a <v-row> with <v-img> or <img> for preview.
Add checkboxes if you want manual deselection before export.
Button “Download ZIP” replaces immediate download after slicing.
